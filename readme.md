## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use my own background images?
Yes! Any .jpg or .png will work. Make sure it’s size is large enough to fill the screen to avoid pixelation. 1920 x1280 usually works fine.

### Can I use my own logo?
Yes! The logo will appear in the center of the screen, either on a background color of your choice or on top of the background image you selected.

### What's a good size for the logo?
It depends. 400 x 200 px is a good starting point. If you have a background image you may want to scale it so that it looks good on the background you selected.

### Which browsers and mobile devices are supported?
N360 Splash Screen uses CSS3 to style the landing page. All recent browsers which support CSS3 are supported. The plugin was tested on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge as well as on iOS and Android.
